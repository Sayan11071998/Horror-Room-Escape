# Horror Room Escape

**Horror Room Escape** is a first-person psychological horror game built in Unity. The player is trapped inside a haunted mansion and must explore, solve puzzles, and maintain sanity to escape. With immersive audio-visual design, unpredictable horror events, and an evolving environment, this game creates a deeply atmospheric and unsettling experience.

## ðŸ”¦ Immersive Gameplay Features

- **Trapped in a Haunted Mansion**  
  Navigate a multi-room layout including drawing room, kitchen, hallway, and hidden sections, each with unique ambient effects and horror triggers.

- **Sanity-Based Health System**  
  Exposure to darkness and supernatural events drains the playerâ€™s sanity. Players must stay in light and avoid repeated exposure to preserve health.

- **Achievement System**  
  Unlock dynamic in-game achievements such as:
  - `KEYMASTER`: Found all hidden keys.
  - `SANITY SAVER`: Maintained high sanity levels.
  - `TORMENTED SURVIVOR`: Escaped with minimal sanity remaining.  
  Achievements are managed directly through the Unity Editor using custom tools.

  Lights suddenly turn off when players stray too far, accompanied by creepy baby laughter.

- **Rat Rush**  
  Triggers a sudden swarm of rats as players cross thresholds.

- **Skull Drop**  
  Randomized falling skulls simulate jump scares and ambient dread.

- **Creepy Doll Appearances**  
  Red-eyed dolls appear and vanish, unsettling players during exploration.

- **Hall of Whispers**  
  A flickering hallway filled with whispers and shadows reacts to player proximity.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings and Technical Highlights

- **Level Design & Environment Storytelling**  
  Built a modular, reusable haunted mansion environment with visual and lighting cues to guide and mislead players.

- **Observer Pattern**  
  Implemented the Observer pattern to trigger and synchronize multiple horror events across the scene.

- **Event-Driven Architecture**  
  Used C# delegates and events to allow loose coupling between systems for improved modularity and scalability.

- **Flexible Action Handlers**  
  Employed `Action` and `Action<T>` delegates for clean, extensible event callbacks.

- **Dynamic Audio-Visual System**  
  Real-time audio cues, flickering lights, and reactive particles respond to game triggers and player choices.

- **Unity Editor Integration**  
  Built custom editor tools to streamline the creation of events, achievements, and sanity modifiersâ€”supporting agile development and iteration.

- **Performance Optimization**  
  Balanced simultaneous event triggering while ensuring smooth performance across mid-range hardware.
